# Capstone Project - Level 2

## Overview

This website is my submission for the Level 2 Capstone Project. It demonstrates the skills and concepts learned throughout the course, including HTML5, CSS (with Bootstrap), JavaScript, and API integration.

## Features

The website includes the following features:

* **Multi-page Structure:** The site has multiple pages (Home, About Us, Contact) with a Bootstrap navigation bar.

* **Data Display:**
* Data is presented in a Bootstrap-styled table.
* **API Integration:**

* **Accessibility:**
* The site includes `alt` text for images and uses ARIA attributes for improved accessibility.
* **Preformatted Text:**
